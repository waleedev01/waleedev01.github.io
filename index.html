      <h3>Waleed Hassan</h3>
      <p>Hello my name's Waleed. I am currently studying BSc of Computer Science at City, University of London. I think my high school gave me a good foundation to face university. During high school I mostly programmed in C and Java, while in the final year we did some web developement with: HTML5, CSS3, PHP and mySQL. In my spare time, apart from programming, I enjoy playing football and cricket.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I created a mini snooker in which 
	details of each tree (e.g. position, trunk color and size, crown color and shape) 
	are stored in parallel 2D arrays. Trees are arranged in a regular grid but their 
	positions are jittered by  small random offsets to create the impression of a real 
	forest. Similarly, each tree trunk and crown has a individual color shade, obtained
	using  random variations of brown and green. Finally, the forest changes over time:
	trees grow and their crowns become more pale to suggest seasonal change ( from 
        spring to autumn).
