      <h1>Waleed Hassan</h1>
      <p>Hello my name's Waleed. I am currently studying BSc of Computer Science at City, University of London. I think my high school gave me a good foundation to face university. During high school I mostly programmed in C and Java, while in the final year we did some web developement with: HTML5, CSS3, PHP and mySQL. In my spare time, apart from programming, I enjoy playing football and cricket.</p>

    <h1>Bootcamp 2020: Snooker Land</h1>
	
    <p>My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the use of arrays, loops, and groups. 
I have developed a mini snooker game, the goal is to put the white ball in the holes as many times as possible in 60 seconds. 
The table is made up of 6 traditional holes, they are  able to detect if there is a ball inside them thanks to some arithmetic calculations.
 Each time the ball enters the hole the score will be increased by 1.
 The power of the shot depends on the distance of the mouse from the ball, more is the distance more powerful will be the shot.
The game will automatically end after 60 seconds.
